            TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
            easy.</p>
        <p class="font2">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
            program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an
            incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
